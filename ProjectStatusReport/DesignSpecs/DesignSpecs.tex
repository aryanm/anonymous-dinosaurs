\section{Introduction to Booth's algorithm}
The traditional way to compute a signed $M\times N$ multiplication is performed by properly
adding M sign-extended and shifted partial products. A signed multiplication therefore implies
the summation of M partial products and is expected to be slow when M contains many bits.
Each columns sums M bits and gives one or more carry bits to the following, leaving the
multiplication result's MSB waiting for $2\times M-2$ carry signals to be generated. In order to increase
the multiplier's speed and reduce its area, a modified Booth algorithm can be used. For a Radix-4 implementation, this reduces the amount of partial products by a factor of 2.

The Booth algorithm is quite simple; it encodes the multiplier N in overlapping groups of
three bits to generate three control signals, SINGLE, DOUBLE and NEGATE. The decoder can
compute the partial product according to the latter in five different ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\item PP=0's (multiplication by 0)
\item PP=M (multiplication by 1)
\item PP=-M (multiplication by -1)
\item PP=2M (multiplication by 2)
\item PP=-2M (multiplication by -2)
\end{enumerate}


All these partial products are then sign extended appropriately and shifted left by 2 from
each other. The two last stages of the multiplication compute the sum of these partial products.
The result is (M+N) bits wide.

\section{Booth Multiplier Architecture}

Since our application is an 8x8 Booth multiplier, we have broken down the design in four
distinct parts: 1) the encoder, 2) the selector (decoder), 3) the compressor tree and 4) the final
addition. A schematic was created for each wordslice module in Electric and was tested for
DRCs. They were then simulated in ModelSim for verification of correctness.


\subsection{Radix-4 Modified Booth Encoder}

For an 8x8 Booth multiplier, the wordslice encoder is made of 4 bitslice encoder. The
latter encodes the multiplier using N[7:5], N[5:3], N[3:1] and N[1:0]\&0 to generate SINGLE[3:0],
DOUBLE[3:0] and NEGATE[3:0].



\subsection{Booth Selector}

The Booth selector uses the three encoded vectors to generate four different 9bits wide
partial products. Its bitslice design is quite simple; you either shift left by one (multiply by 2) or
invert the bit or both. The wordslice's first subtlety is to remember to add `1' when you negate
the signal, to satisfy the two's complement representation. For that matter, 9 half-adders were
used to sum the NEGATE signal (0 when positive, 1 when negative; propagate). The second
subtlety was in the sign generation. The selector and half-adder would cover almost every
possible case, except when Y= -128 and PP= -2M. The correct answer is 100000000 and sign=0.
A simple 3-stage NAND8 reducer was used to cover this special case.



\subsection{Partial Products Compressor Tree}

The compressor tree uses thirteen [4:2] compressors optimized for area to
sum the columns. Each compressor has five inputs: A, B, C, D and $C_{int-1}$ and three outputs: Sum,
$C_{int}$ and $C_{ext}$. The internal carry $C_{int}$ is propagated to the next column and the external carry $C_{ext}$ is
given to the final addition, thus balancing the propagation delay.


\subsection{Final Addition}

The final addition is done using a 13bits carry-ripple adder. This type of adder is
optimized for area and can easily be implemented in layout, but has the longest propagation
delay of all adders.


\section{8x8 Booth Multiplier Simulation}

An additional simulation was done in Quartus II to test the overall functionality of our Booth
multiplier. The integrated ModelSim simulator was found to be very useful to quickly generate
stimuli vectors. Our moduleâ€™s result is compared to the output of a generic 8x8 multiplier using a
XOR-tree and is tested extensively.

% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
