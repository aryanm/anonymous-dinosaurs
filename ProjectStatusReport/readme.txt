Hello Professor Meyer, 

The current GitRepo directory has all the asked deliverables for the Project Status Report. As you can see version control was extensively used. Each team member forked the repository. Different branches were created and updated for each main part of our design plan (as illustrated in Repo's Network Graph). Furthermore, all texts were written using the respective IEEE LaTeX templates. 

Please kindly check the updated GitRepo with all the defined deliverables. Inside each subpath you will find the proper readme.txt file and the related files:

* Desing part : 
$ ./DesignSpecs = The exploration and the application of the Modified Booth Algorithm are described at the './DesignSpecs' directory. 


* Implementation part : 
$ ./Electric = Fully designed and verified circuit schematics : All the designed modules and submodules are given inside the respective Electric .jelib libraries. Representative images per module are provided. The outcomes of the DRC check are given as well. 

$ ./TestBenches = Complete testbenches. All the System Verilog files, the Verilog decks generated using Electric, the used I/O vector files and the proper PrintScreens are given. 


Sincerely, 
The Anonymous-Dinosaurs Team
