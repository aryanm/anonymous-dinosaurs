Deliverables:

* DRC check - The top-level schematic and all the submodules were verified. 

* PrintScreens - Images of all the implemented submodules (Electric Libraries)

* Libraries - Electric .jelib files

We first implemented any required basic logic gates (e.g optimized XNOR gate) and added them to the muddlib07.jelib Electic library. The building blocks of our design (e.g Booth Encoder, Partial Product Generator etc) were created and added to the wordlib8.jelib Electic library. The top-level schematic was added to the mips8.jelib Electic library.
